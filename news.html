                        <strong>Tuesday, 7/1 vs. Hudson River Rats</strong><br><br>
                        Hudson headed west on I94 for a Tuesday night border battle at Paul Fortin Field. They were ready to play, putting up 2 in the 1st inning. Hudson had no shortage of left-handed pitching, utilizing 3 southpaws to make it tough on Hamel hitters.
                        The Hawks were scoreless until the 6th inning when CF Dominic Adkins tied it up on a 2-run single. However, Hudson took the lead right back in the next inning, scoring 2 on a wild pitch and error.<br><br>
                        Hamel stayed within striking distance for their last chance in the 9th, down 7-4. A Wattermann hit-by-pitch and a pair of singles from Zackrison and Lewin loaded the bases with 1 out. However, the Hudson lefty closer struck out the next 2 Hamel batters to end the game.<br><br>
                        Hamel starting pitcher Sam Hagen went 6 innings, 1 ER, and 6 Ks.<br><br>

                        <strong>Wednesday, 7/2 at St. Anthony Hogs</strong><br><br>
                        The sun proved to be too much for Hamel as the Hawks dropped a non-league game at Palm Field in St. Anthony, 10-2. 
                        <br><br>For Hamel, 3B Jack Lewin hit his 1st home run of the season, and relief pitcher Vann Olson threw 3 1/3 scoreless innings to quiet the Hogs bats.<br><br>

                        <strong>Sunday, 7/6 at Maple Lake Lakers</strong><br><br>
                        Hamel and Maple Lake combined for 33 hits in a wild 11-inning North Star League battle. Maple Lake eventually won on a walk-off in the 11th, 9-8.<br><br>
                        The Hawks were down 6-2 going into the top of the 9th. C Harrison Boughton led off with a walk, and SS Alex Wattermann followed with a double to the left field corner. RF Brady Zackrison singled to score 1, and 3B Jack Lewin grounded into a FC to make it 6-4 with 2 outs. Pinch hitter Jayden Mersereau doubled, and Jack Puncochar was intentionally walked to load the bases. Then, CF Dominic Adkins came up clutch with a 2-run, game-tying single up the middle. SS Ian Farley gave the Hawks an 8-6 lead on a 2-run double.<br><br>
                        Maple Lake fought back in the bottom of the 9th, plating 2 runs on consecutive sac-flys sending the game to extra innings. Hamel bats couldn't find a run in the 10th or 11th, and the Lakers pushed across the winning run in the bottom of the 11th.<br><br>
                        SS Ian Farley, P Alex Wattermann, LF Josh Delange, C Harrison Boughton, and 2B Jack Puncochar all had multiple hits for the Hawks.<br><br>

                        <strong>Friday, 6/27 vs. Loretto Larks</strong><br><br>
                        A strong Friday night crowd was on hand to witness a great battle between reborn Highway 55 rivals Hamel and Loretto. Hamel was looking for revenge after losing to Loretto on the road 5 days earlier. They jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the 1st inning after 2 hard-hit singles by NSL all-stars Alex Wattermann and Brady Zackrison, and a sac-fly from catcher Harrison Boughton.
                        <br><br>Loretto clawed back, putting up 1 run in the 4th and 5th to make it 3-2. They tied it on a bases loaded walk in the 8th and took the lead on a double from Joshua Koskie in the 9th. The Hawks made it interesting in the bottom of the 9th. A leadoff bunt single from catcher Harrison Boughton and a Puncochar walk chased Loretto starting pitcher Andrew Kemper after 8 solid innings. 
                        Loretto reliever Joshua Koskie walked the next batter to make it bases loaded, no outs. However, he struck out the next 3 batters to save the game for the Larks.
                        <br><br>Hamel starting pitcher Jake Vanyo put up 7 strong innings, 1 ER, and 10 Ks.<br><br>

                        <strong>Wednesday, 6/18 at Rockford Crows</strong><br><br>

                        Starting pitcher Jake Vanyo threw a complete game shutout (8 IP, 8 H, 8 Ks, 1 BB) to lead the Hawks to a mercy rule victory 11-0. A few calls were made, and the North Star League had no other choice but to add Vanyo to the All-Star Game roster.  

                        Hamel bats stayed hot, racking up 17 hits including a 4/5 night for RF Brady Zackrison and multi-hit games from C Harrison Boughton, LF Andrew Chlebeck, 2B Jack Lewin, and 3B Jack Puncochar.<br><br>
                        
                        <strong>Friday, 6/20 vs. Litchfield Blues</strong><br><br>
                        Another great night at the plate for Hamel was marred by several defensive miscues, and the visiting Litchfield Blues took the W in 10 innings, 12-9.<br><br>
                        
                        Hamel jumped out to a 3-0 lead after scoring in 3 of the first 4 innings. Litchfield took a 4-3 lead after a poor defensive top of the 5th inning. The Hawks showed some life down 5-3 in the bottom of the 7th; Alex Wattermann tied it up with a 2 RBI single, and 3B Jack Puncochar put the Hawks ahead with an RBI single. Then, Litchfield tied it up in the 8th, and the game went to extra innings. The top of the 10th was another inning-to-forget for the Hawks defense, allowing 6 runs. The Hamel offense went down swinging in the final frame, including this absolute blast off the wall from Jack Lewin.<br><br>

                        Other Hamel offensive highlights included Jack Puncochar (3/5 2 2Bs, 3 Rs, 1 RBI), and Ian Schock (3/5 1 R, 1 RBI, 1 BB) who is now hitting .562.<br><br>
                        <strong>Sunday, 6/22 at Loretto Larks</strong><br><br>
                        The Hawks drop to 0-2 in District 6B play losing to Loretto 9-5. Loretto starting pitcher Miles Nablo got the win, going 7 strong innings while allowing only 1 ER on 4 hits. 
                        <br><br>For the Hawks, RF Brady Zackrison hit a ball to the deepest part of Arnold Klaers Field for a stand-up triple and scored on a sac-fly. CF Josh Delange came up big in the top of the 9th with a 2-run double, but it wasn't enough for a comeback.

                        Ian Schock pitched 5 innings allowing only 2 hits, 1 ER and 8 Ks to put Hamel in position to win on the road.   

                        The Hawks put up 6 runs in the top of the 3rd on 3 walks, 2 HBPs, and a couple hits. From there, good defense (0 errors) and a solid relief appearance from Vann Olson (3 IP, 6 Ks) built a big enough cushion preventing a late Orphan-surge from mattering.<br><br>

                        <strong>Friday, 6/13 vs. Hutchinson Huskies</strong><br><br>

                        One big inning for host Dassel-Cokato was the difference on Sunday. The Saints put up 5 runs in the bottom of the 6th, eventually winning the game 7-2. 
                        <br><br>Sam Hagen debuted on the mound for Hamel, posting a respectable 6 innings, 2 ERs, and 5 Ks. Highlights at the plate for Hamel includes SS Alex Wattermann 2 for 3 (1 RBI, 1 BB) and 2B Jack Lewin 2 for 2 in his first start since returning to the team. The opposing starting pitcher, Jordan Flick, worked an efficient outing, finishing with 7 IP, 5 H and 0 ER on only 76 pitches.

                        <strong>Sunday, 6/1 vs. Maple Lake Lakers</strong><br><br>

                        Jake Vanyo pitched 6 quality innings, giving up only 2 earned runs on 6 hits, but it wasn't enough as the Hawks lost their inaugural North Star League matchup 11-5.  

                        The Hawks strung together 11 hits, matching the Lakers' total, but Maple Lake's aggression on the basepaths was too much for Hamel to handle. The Lakers stole 10 bases, including a steal of home in the 2nd inning.
                        LF Ian Schock went 3 for 6 in his Hawks debut.<br><br>

                        <strong>Wednesday, 6/4 at Maple Plain Diamond Devils</strong><br><br>
                        Hamel traveled west on Highway 12 on a Wednesday night for another North Star League battle at Don Timpe Field. The Hawks came out hot, leading 5-0 going into the bottom of the 3rd. However, an error with 2 outs lead to a 2-run home run, and Maple Plain added 2 more in the 6th inning and 3 in the 8th to take a 7-5 lead.
                        <br><br>Hamel wasn't done though, as Alex Wattermann led off the top of the 9th reaching on a dropped third strike. Brady Zackrison stepped up to the plate donning a new natural-finish hard maple bat. He sent a 1-0 fastball to Long Lake, flipping his bat at the opposing dugout in the process, and the game was tied at 7. 
                        Relief pitcher Vann Olson shut down the Diamond Devils in the bottom of the 9th, and the game was suspended due to darkness. The game will resume in the top of the 10th inning on July 11 with the 2nd matchup to follow immediately after.
                        <br><br>Starting pitcher, Alex Wattermann, went 6 strong innings (9 Ks, 2 ERs)<br><br>
                        <strong>Friday, 6/6 vs. Montrose/Waverly Stingers</strong><br><br>
                        Jake Vanyo was back at it again Friday night, but this time was different. With family in the stands, Vanyo gave each pitch a little extra zip. Vanyo pitched an 8-inning, 1 ER, 7K gem to lead the Hawks.
                        <br><br>The Stingers took an early 2-0 lead on a couple of errors, but the Hawks answered back in the bottom of the 2nd. Zackrison led off with a walk and eventually scored on a groundout by catcher, Harrison Boughton.
                        Then, 3B Jack Puncochar hit a ball further than he ever had before and scored on a Levi Miller single to tie it up at 2. Outfielders Dominic Adkins and Ian Schock each added a single to increase the lead to 4-2.
                        The Stingers stuck around until the bottom of the 7th inning when Hamel added 4 more runs thanks to timely hitting and a huge double from Harrison Boughton.
                        <br><br>
                        Dan Morrill closed the door in the 9th leading to a 8-3 Hamel victory. Humble player of the game, Jake Vanyo, credited his defense for his performance.<br><br>

                        The Hamel Hawks are gearing up for an exciting 2025 season, with the home opener scheduled for May 31st at Paul Fortin Memorial Field. Fans can expect a thrilling matchup against the newly-formed Willmar Indians.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-full" style="display: none;">
                        The team has been hard at work during the offseason, with big changes to the roster and a renewed focus on community engagement. 
                        One of the major changes for the 2025 season - Hamel now competes in a new league! Previously, Hamel competed as an independent (2024) and as a member of Section 2B (2021-2023).
                    
                        <br><br>The Hawks enter the upcoming season as a member of the North Star League. They will play 2 games against fellow Class B foes: Buffalo, Hutchinson, Loretto, Maple Lake, and Maple Plain; and play 1 game against Class C teams: Cokato, Dassel-Cokato, Howard Lake, Litchfield, Montrose/Waverly, and Rockford.
                        Longtime General Manager Greg DeVos expressed excitement: "The North Star League is a respected league in this state. We are looking forward to playing against some of the best teams in the area!"

                    <p class="story-preview">The Hamel Hawks celebrated the unveiling of a state-of-the-art grandstand on June 7, defeating the Maple Plain Diamond Devils 13-12 in front of an excited crowd of just over 300.</p>
                    <p class="story-full" style="display: none;">The Hamel Lions Club and Hamel Athletic Club helped fund the ambitious project, seeking to legitimize Hamel's town ball park in the state of Minnesota. The new grandstand seats over 300 fans and features modern amenities, making it a centerpiece of Fortin Field. "Hamel's field is starting to feel like a town ball park", noted longtime fan Todd "Cees" Hanson.</p>

                    <p class="story-full" style="display: none;">Donated by the Hamel Lions Club, the scoreboard enhances the game-day experience with live video. "We're still learning how to use it," said General Manager Greg DeVos. The Hawks plan to showcase it fully in the 2025 season.</p>
